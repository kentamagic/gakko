    <label>Experiment with different values for the "explosion" of the circle here. In format "float float", eg "10.2 5.8" representing border-width and space, respectively. Just type a well-formatted value in and hover over the top circle and you'll see what i mean (default 24.61 16.61)</label><br/>
    <input id="nav-out" type="text" size="3" placeholder=30 />
    <label>Experiment with different closed radii here (default is 30)</label><br/>
    <input id="nav-in" type="text" size="3" placeholder=90 />
    <label>Experiment with different open radii here (default is 90)</label><br/>
    <input id="nav-width" type="text" size="3" placeholder=20 />
    <label>Stroke width (default is 20)</label>
    <p>Sorry, it's hard to make exactly the logo with just one circle. If you think it's worth pursuing (here, or on the side) i'll look into it. Also, sorry i couldn't replicate the color exactly.</p>
