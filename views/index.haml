        %h2 NEW EXAMINATION OF EDUCATION
        %p GAKKO is a summer project that brings together creative college students from the world to design and execute a summer school in Japan. Through GAKKO we are trying to question the current paradigm of education and suggest a new approach to learning. We think school should be a more creative, motivating, and inspiring place where people are happy to learn and engaged in teaching. We want the world to know that we care about education; at GAKKO we question learning.

        %h2 GAKKO2012 in NAOSHIMA, JAPAN
        %p Summer 2012, the first GAKKO took place in Naoshima, Japan. 12 students from Yale and Harvard traveled to Japan for 3 weeks to design and execute a summer school from sratch. GAKKO invited 30 high school students from 6 countries to participate in the first GAKKO camp which took place from 8/4 to 8/9 in Naoshima. We invited 6 inspiring adults to each teach a class at GAKKO. We still keep in touch with everyone who came to the camp. It was a lot of fun.
